# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025 - My Progress

## Introuduction

This repository documents my learning journey through the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) by DataTalksClub.
I'll be tracking my notes, homework solutions, and any personal projects or experiments related to each module. Each module is treated as a mini-project or a set of related exercises, focusing on building practical data engineering skills.

The goal is to demonstrate my understanding of core concepts, tool proficiency, and problem-solving abilities in data engineering.
